Awesome sound bar. PLEASE NOTE that in order to get optimal sound for your review, you must be providing the SB (Sound Bar) the proper content/coding for it to dlvr what you are expecting. This SB will not replace a proper wired amp and surround system, but if you want a clean, finished, polished, and wireless look. This is the way to go. It has awesome sound, it is loud, it provided an artificial surround. It you match it w/ the Sonos Sub Gen 3, and w/ either the One SL or Sonos Fives, you will not be disappointed.
This Sonos Arc brings life to our Tv watching in our living room. We have 21ft vaulted ceilings 38x45 living room in our newly built home. 85” Sony is swallowed by the room size, never thought by adding this Arc would make a difference. I was wrong. The Sonos Arc has provided depth and a sense of connection to this large room. If you have a large great room The Sonos Arc is the perfect sound bar
I've had surround sound receivers and other sound bars but none compare to the Sonos. When I reviewed soundbars to go with a 65" TV with eARC that allows Dolby Atmos I wanted the best bang for my buck. I had to wait 3 months because of back orders but it was well worth the wait. This soundbar is incredible! I also went with the sub and surround speakers, yes expensive, believe me it's worth it.  You will find yourself looking behind you often thinking there's water running or someone else is in the room, it's fantastic!
I play music a lot, this system is awesome, the sound loud or soft is crystal clear and the bass is powerful. Buy it now or save and get it later, but get it!
Easy   Does it
Very very easy
Excellent Speaker
Perfect Sounds 
Makes my whole system
I have been a long time Sonos junkie since my first purchaseof a Beam. At first the Beam worked well in my space but after some remodelingand the removal of a wall I needed something with more power. I held off on thePlaybar simply because of the rumors of an update and pre-ordered this SonosArc as soon as it was available.

First the appearance:This thing is beautiful. With a very modern styling, drilled grill wrapped around the internals this thing is the only piece in my room that gives my LG C9 a run for it's money in appearance. This styling fits in line with all the newest Sonos products on the market today.  The Arc is also very wide which is why it is recommended for TVs over 50" (pictured with my 65" LG C9)

Weighing in at almost 14 pounds, this soundbar and all its components exude quality. Inside are three tweeters (for higher end sound) and eight woofers for mid-range and bass. What is great and new about this product is that 4 of these drivers aim directly at you while 2 aim out the sides and 2 fire sound upward. This enables Arc to give you sound in all directions, including above you. This addition of upfiring speakers enables the Arc to sound effects for any movies/content coded with Dolby Atmos. 
Setup is easy just like other Sonos products (opened the app, add product and the Arc was instantly recognized). After setting it in place I tuned thru TruePlay (a must do in my opinion) to get the room setup and tuned with my Sonos Sub and Play:1 Surround speakers. Even during the tuning I noticed how well the Arc bounced those sounds off the walls to create the left and right front speaker sounds I felt were lacking with the Beam. First movie I fired up was The Rise of Skywalker and sure enough in the opening scene three Tie Fighters buzzed directly over our heads and made my fiance jump.

For this this next portion please make sure to note the difference when talking about the Sonos Arc (not all capitalized) and the HDMI eARC and ARC ports (fully capitalized). This can cause confusion. In order to get lossless Atmos you must make sure you have an Atmos enabled TV with eARC HDMI ports. If your TV only has ARC HDMI you can still get Atmos but it will not be in its full lossless format, it will be compressed Atmos. All this of course is under the assumption that your content is Atmos. You will know it is working if you pull up your Sonos app and click on the room your Arc is in and will see the "Dolby Atmos" symbol listed under the TV. For my setup I have an Apple TV 4K connected to my LG C9, and the Sonos Arc is connected via the eARC HDMI port.

Listening to sound for music, the Arc is a significant upgrade over the Beam but that should be a given based on the size, power, and quantity of speaker differences between the two. While the sound is great I do not know if I would stop using my Play:5 in the same room for just music, only for parties/gatherings in which the surround and bass speakers would help fill the room more. 

For my purposes I use Google Assistant and the far field mics caught my voice easily even while sound was playing from the speaker and a medium volume.

While a big jump from the Beam pricing and $100 more than it's predecessor, the Arc delivers. While you can get soundbars for under $150, this one is the cream of the crop and is worth the price tag if you can afford. Sonos's ease of use and seamless streaming technology already shine above a lot of it's competitors but the addition of this new Arc soundbar puts them ahead of everyone else in soundbar tech and makes it the soundbar to beat. The Arc is an outstanding speaker and should be the first choice when wanting to convert just a TV into a a surround system in a medium to large sized room.
