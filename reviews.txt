Sounds great and low profile highly recommend it For any Samsung smart TV
I brought this soundbar two days ago and the bar will not connect with my Hisense 58 TV
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Samsung HW-B550 is a 2.1 soundbar. It is the replacement for the HW-A550 but has a few upgrades (I have that one as well). While it is a simple bar that's best for listening to stereo content, it performs well enough with most music and TV show sources. Overall the sound quality is good for this price point.  I did like how easy it was to hook up and use.  The bar is quite intuitive, and takes no special skills to use.  Samsung always does a nice job with their apps, and this one is not an exception.   While there is no Dolby Atmos there is Dolby Audio, DTS, DTS X and base boost to give a more immersive experience.  This is a great soundbar for smaller rooms.  Is it as detail and enhancement rich as it's big brothers? NO.  It does deliver nice sound at a reasonable price point.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this sound bar to compliment my new Samsung TV in my entertainment center. It's slim enough that it fit easily under my TV, and the subwoofer fit nice and sung off to the side. 

I cant say how much this has enhanced my viewing experience. In the past I've constantly had to ship my audio settings based on the show or network, but the sound from this Samsung sound bar is crisp, clear and easy to control.

There are multiple  sound settings, and you can adjust the bar & sub independently. 

My only complaint is that you need to use the SAMSUNG remote if using the optical audio cable. The universal remote for my TV could not adjust the volume of the sound bar.
[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This sound system was a huge upgrade from the previous one we had. The sound was clear and distinguishable. We loved the way the explosions shook us and the softness of when rain was falling. We enjoy the slimness of the sound bar as it fits well on our TV stand. The woofer is also small and able to fit in a tight spot. We love the sound quality we get from this system.
